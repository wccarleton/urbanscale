## Abstract

Over half of the world’s human population now lives in cities as part of a trend that will only increase in the decades to come. Urban areas will increasingly act as critical sites of production and innovation, public-health challenges, human-environment interactions, and ideological and material expression and exchange. Quantitative models predicting scaling relationships between urban population size, infrastructure, innovation, and economic output have been developed for both past and present urban contexts. However, they have yet to be deployed to explore the ways in which urban growth and symbolic and ideological systems are related. Here, we apply the tools of Settlement Scaling Theory to a sample of ancient and modern cities in order to explore whether ‘symbolic infrastructure’ follows the same scaling patterns identified for other urban attributes and whether those patterns were the same for the ancient and modern cases. For the ancient case, we compared estimated urban population sizes and monument numbers for the Roman Empire between 100BC and 300AD. For the modern case, we compared counts of Church of England churches in the United Kingdom to current urban areas in the UK. Our analysis revealed potential differences in ‘symbolic scaling’ between urban areas and different types of monuments that we argue can be used to assess the relationship between social structure, settlement and ideology. We highlight the contemporary relevance of archaeology and history in providing a unique time-depth of observations of urban-socioeconomic-ideological interactions that can better inform future predictions connected to this increasingly dominant way of human life.

## Software
The R scripts contained in this repository are intended for replication efforts and to improve the transparency of research. They are, of course, provided without warranty or technical support. That said, questions about the code can be directed to me, Chris Carleton, at ccarleton@protonmail.com.

### R
This analysis described in the associated manuscript was performed in R. Thus, you may need to download the latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in order to make use of the scripts described below.

### Nimble
This project made use of a Bayesian Analysis package called [Nimble](https://r-nimble.org/). See the Nimble website for documentation and a tutorial. Then, refer to the R scripts in this repo.
